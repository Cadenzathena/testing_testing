Freud first introduced the concept of Thanatos, the death instinct, in his essay "Beyond the Pleasure Principle." He theorized that humans are driven toward death and destruction, famously declaring that "the aim of all life is death."

Freud believed that people typically channel this death drive outward, which manifests as aggression toward others.4 People also can direct this drive inward, however, which can result in self-harm or suicide.
Freud based this theory on clinical observations, noting that people who experience a traumatic event often recreate or revisit it. For example, he noted that soldiers returning from World War I tended to revisit their traumatic experiences in dreams that repeatedly took them back to combat.

From these observations, he concluded that people hold an unconscious desire to die but that life instincts largely temper this wish. In Freud's view, the compulsion to repeat was "something that would seem more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it overrides." Thus, Thanatos stands in stark contrast to the drive to survive, procreate, and satisfy desires.

The death drive, in particular, is one of Freud's most disputed and complicated theories. Some see the death drive as incompatible with the sanctity of life and an explanation for (or even encouragement of) suicide. Some, like Todd Dufresne, professor of Philosophy at Lakehead University, even outright reject its existence. Psychoanalyst and psychotherapist Ben Kafka, associate professor at New York University, believes the concept to be flawed and not particularly relevant to contemporary life.
